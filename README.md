First Website

==================== Description ====================
This is my first ever Website. There is a lot of work since it was created following some tutorials & learning by my own (watching youtube), so don't expect anything else.

==================== Problems ====================
To be honest I had some troubles at the CSS part because I just use this site to practice and improve myself so I decided to hide 'x' & 'y' coordenates and make it static.
Other problems were trying to add music because the chrome's term of use that you can't play music without user consent so I decided to add a button to play & pause music. 
At the end I just liked how everything it's working.

==================== Comments ====================
Feel free to judge it by keep in mind I won't change anything because it's currently finished and its here just to remind me where I started. 
No one start his life knowing everything and the knowledge is something that you get working everyday step by step so this was my first one.
